# Challenge Description: Fibonacci Sequence

## Challenge

Write a program that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, where n is a user input.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first few numbers in the sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

Your program should generate the first n numbers in the sequence, where n is a user input.

## Problem Statement

Your program should take an integer n as input from the user, and generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The output should be printed to the console.

Your program should start with the first two numbers in the sequence, 0 and 1. The third number in the sequence is the sum of the first two numbers (0 + 1 = 1), the fourth number is the sum of the second and third numbers (1 + 1 = 2), and so on.

## Example

Here is an example output of what your program should produce if the user inputs 10:

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34


## Constraints

+ The program should output to the console.
+ The program should take an integer n as input from the user.
+ The program should generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
+ The output should be correct and in the correct format.
