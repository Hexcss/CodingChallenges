# Challenge Description: Palindrome Checker

## Challenge

Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "racecar" or "level").

Your program should take a string as input and output whether it is a palindrome or not.

## Problem Statement

Your program should take a string as input from the user and determine if it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because it reads the same backward and forward.

Your program should ignore case (i.e., treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same) and should ignore any spaces or punctuation in the input string.

Your program should output either "True" if the input string is a palindrome, or "False" if it is not.

## Example

Here are some examples of what your program should produce:

Example 1:

Input: "racecar"
Output: True

Example 2:

Input: "A man a plan a canal Panama"
Output: True

Example 3:

Input: "hello world"
Output: False

## Constraints

+ The program should output to the console.
+ The program should take a string as input.
+ The program should determine if the input string is a palindrome.
+ The program should ignore case and any spaces or punctuation in the input string.
+ The output should be correct and in the correct format.
